## Running the Scripts

To run the scripts located in the `example/case/` directory, add the `src` folder to your Python path.

### Dependencies

#### Acoustic Toolbox Kraken

The package relies on the Acoustic Toolbox Kraken to compute T-wave modes (via `src/KRAKEN_mode_func.m`). Kraken is maintained by oalib. To use this package:

1. Download the Acoustic Toolbox source files (named "at") from the following link:  
   [Acoustic Toolbox - Kraken](http://oalib.hlsresearch.com/AcousticsToolbox/)  
   (If this link changes, please refer to the latest address on the oalib website.)

2. After downloading, add `at/bin` to your systemâ€™s `$PATH` environment variable.

3. In MATLAB, add `at/` to the MATLAB path by running the following command:
   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath('/path/to/your/at/'));
   savepath;

   This ensures that KRAKEN_mode_func.m can find and execute Kraken correctly.

4. Additionally, some useful scripts in the at/Matlab/Plot directory (e.g., at/Matlab/Plot/plotmode.m) can be helpful for visualizing 
   results and understanding the structure of mode files.

For further details, refer to the Kraken manual located in at/doc/kraken.htm within the downloaded package.

### Ocean Acoustic Package ORCA
This package also includes the ORCA ocean acoustics package and its MATLAB wrapper (written by YT Lin, UCSD). For more information, visit:
ORCA - Ocean Acoustics

Note for Mac Users: Wenbo Wu encountered issues when installing the wrapper on a Mac with ARM64 architecture versus x86_64. These 
issues were resolved by installing the x86_64 version of gfortran.
