1. The ocean sound speed profile is truncated at the seafloor depth, determined as the shallower value between the filled ECCO dataset and the "ELVE" depth specified in data/loc_seafloor_cutoff.txt.
For ECCO, the cutoff depth is the deepest point along the N-S path, as SoundSpeed_ECCO.py computes the profile using np.nanmean(c_path, axis=0), with the last depth representing the deepest value.
The "ELVE" depths for the hydrophones are shallower than the ECCO cutoff depths in this case.
The length of the N-S path is user-specified (path_extend_distance in the bash script, default: 50,000 m).

2. The underlying solid layer is modeled using the PREM crustal structure.
