The ocean sound speed profile is truncated at the seafloor depth, 
determined as the shallower one between the filled ECCO and ETOPO1 datasets.
The cutoff depth for both ECCO and ETOPO1 is determined by searching within an 
extended range, using a specified distance (default: 50,000 m).
The underlying solid layer is modeled based on the PREM crustal structure.

ORCA results are consistent with that by KRAKEN, but ORCA is better at dealing with 
elastic layers (i.e., more complex solid Earth layers are allowed).
