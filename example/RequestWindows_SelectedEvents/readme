1. Download ISC catalog, select the target events and save it as data/ISC_catalog.txt. The strategy of selecting 
   good events is based on the ray path maps of all the events (see ../RequestWindows/) and their T-waves at RAR.
2. Put the names of selected floats into file data/floats.txt. 
3. python determine_windows.py. Adjust the parameters in determine_windows.py as needed. Currently, 
   the requested time window is 70 second before and 170 second after the predicted T-wave arrival time.
   The list of requested time windows for each float is saved in results/request_window.txt. The ray path maps are
   saved in results/raypath_figure/.
