1. Download ISC catalog, select the target events and save it as data/ISC_catalog.txt. The strategy used here is to 
   select good events as fllowing, (a) first do the workflow described here using the full ISC catalog to produce 
   ray path maps for each event, then (b) based on the maps and T-wave at RAR to select the good events.
2. Put the names of selected floats into file data/floats.txt. 
3. python determine_windows.py. adjust the parameters in determine_windows.py as needed. Currently, 
   the requested time window is 70 second before and 170 second after the predicted T-wave arrival time.
   The list of requested time windows for each float is saved in results/request_window.txt. The ray path maps are
   waved in results/raypath_figure/.
