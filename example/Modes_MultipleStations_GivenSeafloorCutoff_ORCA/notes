1. The ocean sound speed profile is truncated at the seafloor depth, determined as the shallower value between the filled ECCO and ETOPO1 datasets.
For ECCO, the cutoff depth is the deepest point along the N-S path, as SoundSpeed_ECCO.py computes the profile using np.nanmean(c_path, axis=0), with the last depth representing the deepest value.
For ETOPO1, the cutoff depth is the average depth along the extended search range. As a result, in most cases, the computed modes terminate at the ETOP01 averaged depth.
The length of the N-S path is user-specified ("path_extend_distance" in the bash script and default: 50,000 m).

2. The underlying solid layer is modeled using the PREM crustal structure.

3. ORCA results are consistent with that by KRAKEN, but ORCA is better at dealing with
elastic layers (i.e., more complex solid Earth layers are allowed).
