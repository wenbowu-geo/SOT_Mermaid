The ocean sound speed profile is truncated at the seafloor depth, which is specified in 
the last column of data/loc_seafloor_cutoff.txt. 
The underlying solid layer is modeled based on the PREM crustal structure.

ORCA results are consistent with that by KRAKEN, but ORCA is better at dealing with
elastic layers (i.e., more complex solid Earth layers are allowed).
